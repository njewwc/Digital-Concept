# *How to make a simple web page using HTML*

by Nicholas Engelhard

## Step 1: the setup
The proper way to set up any html project is to first make sure you have the necessary pieces to build upon

1. *html* is the first tag, it is what tells whatever is loading the document that it is html. Everything must be placed inside of the html tags if it wants to be included in the page

2. *head* is the second tag. This tag contains the title tag along with other things that are more advanced such as style sheets and links.

3. The *title* tag goes inside of the head tag and it controls the what goes at the top bar when the page is opened. To edit the text you would have <title> Text For Title Here </title>

4. The *body* tag goes below the head tag and is used for the actual content on the page. Inside this tag you can do many things such as link to an image or even just writing your name on the webpage. Here is an example of creating some text within the body tag 
</br>

`<body>`

     `<h1> hello world</h1>`
  
 `</body>`
 
 ## Step 2: putting it all together
 In this step we will be assembling all the tags to see what it all looks like together
 
 `<html>`
 
     `<head>`
     
          `<title> welcome to the page </title>`
          
     `</head>`
 
     `<body>`

     `<h1> hello world</h1>`
  
     `</body>`
     
 `</html>`
 
 
 ## Step 3: Opening the file
 In this step we will be opening the file and displaying it on the browser.
 
 To do this, using whatever text editor of your chosing you must go to save as and save the document with .html at the end, this insures that the computer/browser will open the file and recognize what you are trying to do.
 
 To open the file, right click and press open with (browser of choice here) and your webpage will be displayed. This is only for your local computer as it is not hosted on a serer but it is a handy way to try things out
