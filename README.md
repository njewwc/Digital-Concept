# *How to make a simple web page using HTML*

by Nicholas Engelhard

## Step 1: the setup
The proper way to set up any html project is to first make sure you have the necessary pieces to build upon

1. *html* is the first tag, it is what tells whatever is loading the document that it is html. Everything must be placed inside of the html tags if it wants to be included in the page

2. *head* is the second tag. This tag contains the title tag along with other things that are more advanced such as style sheets and links.

3. The *title* tag goes inside of the head tag and it controls the what goes at the top bar when the page is opened. To edit the text you would have <title> Text For Title Here </title>

4. The *body* tag goes below the head tag and is used for the actual content on the page. Inside this tag you can do many things such as link to an image or even just writing your name on the webpage. Here is an example of creating some text within the body tag 
`<body>`
     `<h1> hello world</h1>`
  
 `</body>`
