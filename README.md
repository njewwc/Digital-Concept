# *How to make a simple web page using HTML*

by Nicholas Engelhard

## Step 1: the setup
The proper way to set up any html project is to first make sure you have the necessary pieces to build upon

1. html is the first tag, it is what tells whatever is loading the document that it is html. Everything must be placed inside of the html tags if it wants to be included in the page

2. head is the second tag. This tag contains the title tag along with other things that are more advanced such as style sheets and links.

3. The title tag goes inside of the head tag and it controls the what goes at the top bar when the page is opened. To edit the text you would have <title> Text For Title Here </title>
